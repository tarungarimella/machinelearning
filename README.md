# ML_Assignment_1 brief introduction :
Jupiter notebook is the platform used for compilation of python codes.This assignment gave me the knowledge about the basics in python programming like usage of tuples,lists,sets,dictionaries and caluclated area by using string formatting techniques. By using KNN classifier i also predicited the output of a sample, also caluclated the accuracy,sensivity and specificity values of the sample.

# ML_Assignment_2 brief introduction :
This assignement provides me the knowledge about the nested loops and slicing of lists.I have learned about the datatypes in python then i came to know about different methods like in and not in. Finally in last program i have implemented is.upper() and is.lower() methods.

# ML_Assignment_3 brief introduction :
Jupiter notebook is the platform used for performing operations on numpy and matplotlib libraries in python. Numpy is useful for for large multi-dimensional array and matrix processing where as Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.Here in this assignment i have implemeneted properties like shape,type,datatype of array and computing eigen vectors, eigen values of array along with caluclating sum of diagonal elements in array using numpy library in python and I have created a pie chart of programming languages using matplotlib library in python.

# ML_Assignment_4 brief introduction :
Classifaction programs are done in this assignment.Differenet data modelas are trained using naive bayes and svm classifiers which are basically linear classifiers.
By training the moldels we have found out naive bayes have provided better output when compared to the svm linear classifier.
